# sudoku-challenge
A ruby program that solves simple sudoku games

##Summary:
  This was a challenge I completed at DBC to solve a sudoku puzzle using Ruby.  The input is a string of 81 characters and the ouput is a completed and formated sudoku board.

**How to use:**

in terminal(run these commands):

  git clone https://github.com/lukasjones/sudoku-challenge.git
  cd sudoku-challenge/source
  ruby runner.rb
  
  
  
runner.rb inputs the unfinished sudoku boards and ouputs the completed sudoku boards.  There are multiple boards being input so the output might be a look a little tall.
